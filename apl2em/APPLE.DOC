		     Apple Emulator Documentation


		This is the documentation for the IBM 286/386 Apple ][
	emulator. The emulator is not quite complete but since it is a
	"for fun" project I thought that I would go ahead and release
	what I currently have. The following describes the stage of
	completion for each of the Apple ][ emulator sections:

		Video	      - The emulator will run on a CGA, EGA, or
				VGA, however, it looks much better on an
				EGA or VGA. All the Apple ][ video modes
				are supported except mixed mode with 4
				lines of text at the bottom of the graphics
				screen. Low resolution and high resolution
				graphics are supported.

		Keyboard      - The keyboard functions as an Apple ][
				keyboard except for the following keys:

				PrtSc - Exit the Apple ][ Emulator
			Scroll	Lock  - Change the screen update method
			Num	Lock  - Toggle between keypad and joystick

				Some programs run faster depending on the
				video update method. Try toggling the scroll
				lock to see if the program runs faster.

		Joystick      - A joystick is emulated using the numeric
				keypad. See the joystick.doc file for more
				information on joystick modes, ajustments, etc.

		Disk Drive    - Only Apple ][ floppy type drives are supported
				now, I need more information on how a Apple
				hard disk works. The floppies are emulated by
				have PC disk files named DISKxy.DSK, where:

				x - Is the slot number of the disk controller

				y - Is the drive number, a or b

				For example, if you had a disk controller in
				slot 6, the default the file DISK6A.DSK would
				be the Apple ][ disk image.

		Langauge Card - A 32k langauge card is supported and can be
				accessed via standard langauge card methods.

		Serial Card   - Sorry but there is no serial support yet, again
				I need more information about the Apple ][
				serial port.


		Well there is really a lot more to this but since I'm giving
	out the source you can look at it for yourself. I plan on adding a lot
	of other features but I'm not sure when I will get around to them.
	Until then I hope you enjoy what I have done so far, thanks again.
